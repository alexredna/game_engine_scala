## Description

Scala Jazz is a Scala DSL meant for fast and easy GUI and animation creation. To do this, Scala Jazz uses Java Swing. Java Swing is running the animator and maintaining status of the visualized objects, while Scala processes the language, and performs all of the computations necessary for the visualization. The DSL itself is an original design by the authors.
